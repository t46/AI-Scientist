#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Interdisciplinary Idea Generation: Integrating Diverse Perspectives for Automated Research Paper Generation.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: In this experiment, we extend the generate_ideas() function to incorporate insights from multiple disciplines (e.g., computer science, cognitive science, philosophy). We will use predefined themes or domains to guide the idea generation process. The generated ideas will then be evaluated using the review score from perform_review() as the evaluation metric. The results will be compared with the baseline idea generation method to assess the impact of interdisciplinary perspectives..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'result': {'Soundness': 2.0, 'Presentation': 2.0, 'Contribution': 2.0, 'Overall': 3.0, 'Confidence': 4.0, 'Originality': 2.0, 'Quality': 2.0, 'Clarity': 2.0, 'Significance': 2.0, 'Decision_Numeric': 0.0, 'Ethical_Concerns_Numeric': 0.0}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

### Plan for Experiments

We will conduct the following experiments to integrate diverse perspectives into the idea generation process:

1. **Run 1: Computer Science Perspective**
   - Generate ideas focusing on computer science themes.
   
2. **Run 2: Cognitive Science Perspective**
   - Generate ideas focusing on cognitive science themes.
   
3. **Run 3: Philosophy Perspective**
   - Generate ideas focusing on philosophy themes.
   
4. **Run 4: Combined Perspectives**
   - Generate ideas by combining insights from computer science, cognitive science, and philosophy.

5. **Run 5: Randomized Perspectives**
   - Generate ideas by randomly selecting themes from the three disciplines.

### Implementation Steps

1. Modify the `generate_ideas` function to accept a `theme` parameter.
2. Update the `experiment.py` to run the experiments with the specified themes.

Let's start by modifying the `generate_ideas` function to accept a `theme` parameter.

#### Step 1: Modify `generate_ideas` function

First, we need to update the `generate_ideas` function in the `idea_generation_module.py` file. Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

#### FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/root/AI-Scientist/results/templates/2d_diffusion/seed_ideas.json'  

The error indicates that the file `seed_ideas.json` is missing. To proceed, we need to ensure that this file exists in the specified directory or modify the code to handle the absence of this file gracefully.

Let's modify the `generate_ideas` function to handle the missing `seed_ideas.json` file by providing a default set of seed ideas if the file is not found.

Please add the `idea_generation_module.py` file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To handle the missing `seed_ideas.json` file gracefully, we will modify the `generate_ideas` function to provide a default set of seed ideas if the file is not found.

Please add the `idea_generation_module.py` file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.
