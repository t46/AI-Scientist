The generate_ideas function will be modified to accept and process both types of inputs, utilizing pre-trained models for image analysis. We will start with a dataset of medical literature and corresponding images (e.g., MRI, X-ray) to generate healthcare research ideas. The impact of multi-modal idea generation will be evaluated by comparing the novelty, feasibility, and interestingness scores of the generated ideas against a baseline of text-only ideas, using the perform_review function.",
