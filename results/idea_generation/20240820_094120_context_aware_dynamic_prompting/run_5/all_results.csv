20240820_133141_learning_rate_schedule,"This paper investigates the impact of various adaptive learning rate schedules on the performance of diffusion models. The authors conduct a comprehensive comparison of different learning rate schedules, including cosine annealing, exponential decay, step decay, and cyclic learning rates. The evaluation is based on final estimated KL divergence, training time, and evaluation loss across multiple 2D datasets. The study aims to provide insights and recommendations for selecting appropriate learning rate schedules for diffusion models.","['Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the learning rate schedules?', 'Have the authors considered combining multiple adaptive learning rate schedules for potential improvements?', 'What is the impact of these learning rate schedules on higher-dimensional datasets?', 'Why were only 2D datasets used in the experiments?
