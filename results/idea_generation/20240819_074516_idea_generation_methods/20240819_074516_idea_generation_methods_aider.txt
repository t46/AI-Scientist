#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Idea Generation Methods: Comparing different idea generation methods for automated research paper generation..  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: In this experiment, we compare the performance of different idea generation methods (perform_generate_idea()) on automated research paper generation performance. We use the review score by (perform_review()) as the evaluation metric..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'result': {'Soundness': 2.0, 'Presentation': 2.0, 'Contribution': 2.0, 'Overall': 3.0, 'Confidence': 4.0, 'Originality': 2.0, 'Quality': 2.0, 'Clarity': 2.0, 'Significance': 2.0, 'Decision_Numeric': 0.0, 'Ethical_Concerns_Numeric': 0.0}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

### Plan for Experiments

We will compare different idea generation methods by modifying the `generate_ideas` function call. We will run the following experiments:

1. **Run 1**: Use the default idea generation method.
2. **Run 2**: Use a different model for idea generation.
3. **Run 3**: Increase the number of ideas generated.
4. **Run 4**: Increase the number of reflections.
5. **Run 5**: Combine different models and increased reflections.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Run 1**: No changes needed as it uses the default settings.
2. **Run 2**: Change the model used for idea generation.
3. **Run 3**: Increase the number of ideas generated.
4. **Run 4**: Increase the number of reflections.
5. **Run 5**: Combine different models and increased reflections.

Let's start with **Run 2** by changing the model used for idea generation.

### Run 2: Change the Model for Idea Generation

We will modify the `MODEL` parameter to use a different model for idea generation.

#### Changes for Run 2

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
MODEL = "gpt-4o-2024-05-13"
=======
MODEL = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

After making this change, you can run the command:
```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_2
```

Please confirm if you would like to proceed with this change or if you have any modifications to the plan.

#### ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ai_scientist'  

The error indicates that the `ai_scientist` module is not found. This could be due to an incorrect path or missing module. To resolve this, we need to ensure that the `ai_scientist` module is correctly imported.

Let's modify the import statements to ensure the correct path is used.

### Changes for Import Path

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from ai_scientist.perform_experiments import perform_experiments
from ai_scientist.perform_writeup import perform_writeup, generate_latex
from ai_scientist.perform_review import perform_review, load_paper
=======
from ..ai_scientist.perform_experiments import perform_experiments
from ..ai_scientist.perform_writeup import perform_writeup, generate_latex
from ..ai_scientist.perform_review import perform_review, load_paper
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please update the file with the above changes and try running the experiment again. If the `ai_scientist` module is located in a different directory, please provide the correct path.
