We label and evaluate ideas based on their originating persona and compare the performance of experiments derived from these diverse ideas using the perform_review() function. The success will be measured by review scores and the diversity of topics and approaches covered.",

We will create specialized prompts for each discipline and generate ideas accordingly. These ideas will be labeled based on their originating discipline. We will then evaluate the performance of experiments derived from these cross-disciplinary ideas using the perform_review() function. Success will be measured by review scores and the interdisciplinary nature of the topics and approaches covered.",
