This involves using pre-defined categories such as natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering to generate ideas within these contexts. We will then combine these ideas to form a final set of research ideas. The performance of these ideas will be compared against those generated without this integration, using review scores from perform_review() as our evaluation metric.",

We will analyze the frequency and trends of keywords in past research papers to identify emerging trends and gaps in the literature.
