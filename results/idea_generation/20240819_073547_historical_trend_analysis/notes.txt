# Title: Incorporating Historical Trend Analysis in Idea Generation for Timely and Relevant Research
# Experiment description: This experiment will involve modifying the generate_ideas() function to incorporate historical trend analysis. We will analyze the frequency and trends of keywords in past research papers to identify emerging trends and gaps in the literature. The modified function will use this information to generate ideas that are timely and relevant. The performance of these ideas will be compared against those generated without historical analysis, using review scores from perform_review() as the evaluation metric.
