    "Summary": "The paper introduces a method for embedding ethical considerations into automated research paper generation. This is done by incorporating ethical prompts and an ethical review checklist into the idea generation process. The goal is to ensure that the generated ideas are not only innovative and high-quality but also ethically sound. The method is validated through experiments comparing baseline idea generation with the ethically enhanced approach.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The topic is highly relevant and timely, addressing the growing need for responsible AI-driven innovation.",
        "The idea of integrating ethical prompts and a review checklist is novel and has the potential to enhance the ethical soundness of AI-generated content."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks depth in experimental validation. The results do not show a significant improvement in ethical soundness.",
        "The methodology section is not detailed enough, particularly concerning the ethical prompts and review checklist.",
        "The impact of ethical considerations on the actual quality and novelty of the generated ideas is not convincingly demonstrated.",
        "The results section includes metrics that show only slight improvements, and some metrics remain unchanged, indicating that the method may not be as effective as claimed.",
        "The paper is poorly organized and often repetitive, making it challenging to follow the logical flow of the arguments.",
        "The significance of the results is limited, with minimal impact on the generated content.",
        "The paper lacks detailed ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component (ethical prompts and review checklist) separately.",
        "There is no discussion on the potential negative societal impacts of the work."

    "Questions": [
        "Can you provide more detailed descriptions of the ethical prompts and review checklist?",
        "How were the ethical guidelines chosen and implemented in the prompts and checklist?",
        "Can you explain why the ethical soundness scores did not show significant improvement despite the proposed method?",
        "What specific metrics were used to measure the quality, novelty, and ethical soundness of the generated ideas?",
        "Can the authors provide detailed ablation studies to show the contribution of each component separately?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper acknowledges that the impact on ethical concerns remains negligible, which is a major limitation given the focus of the study.",
        "The limited number of ideas and reflections used in the experiments may not fully capture the potential of the proposed approach.",
        "The subjective nature of ethical guidelines poses a challenge in creating a universally applicable solution."
