20240819_164152_controllable_generation,"The paper proposes modifications to the MLPDenoiser model to accept conditional inputs for controlled data generation. Various techniques for integrating the conditional input are explored, including simple concatenation, separate linear layers, multi-layer perceptrons, and attention mechanisms. The effectiveness of these modifications is validated through experiments on 2D datasets.","['How does the proposed method compare to other state-of-the-art conditional generative models in terms of performance on more complex datasets?', 'Can the authors provide more theoretical insights into why the proposed conditional input mechanisms are effective?', 'How sensitive is the model to the choice of hyperparameters, and how were these hyperparameters selected?', 'Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the attention mechanism?', 'Are there any plans to evaluate the method on higher-dimensional and more complex datasets?', 'Can the authors provide additional ablation studies to better understand the impact of each conditional input mechanism?', 'How can the computational cost associated with the more complex conditioning mechanisms be mitigated?']","['The paper does not adequately address the limitations associated with the increased computational cost of more complex conditioning mechanisms.', ""The application of the method to more complex datasets is not explored, which limits the understanding of the method's scalability and robustness."", 'The potential negative societal impacts of controlled data generation, such as misuse in generating misleading or harmful content, are not discussed.']",False,2,2,2,3,4,"['Addresses an important problem of controlled data generation in generative models.', 'Explores multiple techniques for integrating conditional inputs, providing a comprehensive comparison.', 'The experimental setup and evaluation metrics are clearly defined, and the results are thoroughly analyzed.']","['The novelty of the approach is limited.
