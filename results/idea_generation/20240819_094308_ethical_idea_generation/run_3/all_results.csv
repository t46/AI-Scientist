20240819_150222_learning_rate_schedule,"The paper investigates the impact of various adaptive learning rate schedules on the performance of diffusion models, focusing on the final estimated KL divergence as the evaluation metric. It systematically compares different learning rate schedules, including StepLR, ExponentialLR, CosineAnnealingLR, and ReduceLROnPlateau, against a constant learning rate baseline. The study is validated through extensive experiments on multiple 2D datasets, providing insights into optimizing diffusion model training.","['Can the authors provide more experiments on higher-dimensional datasets?', 'Is it possible to include a theoretical analysis to support the empirical findings?', 'Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the experimental setups to enhance reproducibility?', 'Have the authors considered applying their findings to higher-dimensional datasets or other types of diffusion models?', 'Can the authors provide a more in-depth analysis and discussion on why certain learning rate schedules perform better than others?', 'How do the authors plan to address the potential negative societal impact of their work?', 'Can the authors provide more detailed comparisons with recent state-of-the-art techniques for training diffusion models?', 'How would the proposed methods scale to more complex datasets and higher-dimensional data?']","['The study is limited to simple 2D datasets and may not generalize well to more complex, higher-dimensional data.
