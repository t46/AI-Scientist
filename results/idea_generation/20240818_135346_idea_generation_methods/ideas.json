Specifically, we will select pre-trained models or fine-tune existing models on domain-specific datasets. We will use a method to combine and refine these outputs, such as consensus generation or ensemble methods. The performance of interdisciplinary idea generation will be compared with single-domain idea generation using review scores, diversity, and coherence of the ideas as evaluation metrics.",

We will present a set of initial ideas to a user (or simulate user feedback), collect feedback (ratings, comments, suggestions) through a simple script, and refine the ideas based on this feedback. We will allow for multiple rounds of feedback and refinement. The performance of this feedback-incorporated idea generation method will be compared with the baseline method using review scores, relevance, and novelty of the generated ideas as evaluation metrics.",
