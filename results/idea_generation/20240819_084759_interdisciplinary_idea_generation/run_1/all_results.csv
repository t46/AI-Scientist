20240819_085031_controllable_generation,"The paper proposes a novel approach to integrate conditional mechanisms into diffusion models to achieve fine-grained control over the generation process. The method aims to balance the quality and diversity of generated samples with the precision of control. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple synthetic datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in control and sample quality over existing methods.","['Can the authors provide a more detailed description of the conditional mechanisms and how they are integrated into the diffusion process?', 'What considerations were made in selecting hyperparameters, and how sensitive is the model to these choices?', 'Can you provide more extensive comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, including detailed results for GANs and VAEs?', 'Please elaborate on the ablation studies, specifically how each component of the proposed method contributes to the overall performance.', 'How does the proposed method compare to other state-of-the-art conditional diffusion models in more detail?', 'Have the authors considered real-world datasets for evaluation to demonstrate practical applicability?', 'How does the proposed method perform on more complex, real-world datasets compared to synthetic ones?', 'How does the model handle cases where the control variable c is noisy or inaccurate?', 'Why were synthetic 2D datasets chosen for the experiments?
