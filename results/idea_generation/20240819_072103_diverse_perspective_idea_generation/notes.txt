# Title: Impact of Diverse Perspectives on Automated Research Paper Generation
# Experiment description: This experiment involves developing a new idea generation method that incorporates diverse disciplinary perspectives by using prompts designed to elicit responses from different fields (e.g., science, humanities, social sciences). We will compare the quality and novelty of research papers generated using this method against those generated using standard methods. The evaluation will utilize the review score by perform_review() as the primary metric.
