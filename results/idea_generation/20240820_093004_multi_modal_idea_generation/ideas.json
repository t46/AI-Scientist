        "Method": "This method integrates historical research trends (using databases like Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar), citation analysis (using citation networks and metrics), and expert opinions (through surveys or expert panels) into the idea generation process. This multi-modal approach is designed to provide a more contextualized and innovative approach to generating research ideas.",
        "Experiment": "1. Develop an initial idea generation model using existing methods.\n2. Collect data on historical research trends from Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar, citation analysis from citation networks, and expert opinions through surveys or expert panels.\n3. Design an integration module to incorporate these data sources into the idea generation algorithm.\n4. Generate and iteratively refine ideas using feedback from these sources by re-evaluating the generated ideas with the new data.\n5. Compare the quality of ideas generated using this multi-modal approach with the baseline method using the review score from perform_review() as the evaluation metric.",
