# Title: Multi-Modal Idea Generation Method for Enhanced Research Innovation
# Experiment description: 1. Develop an initial idea generation model using existing methods.
2. Collect data on historical research trends from Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar, citation analysis from citation networks, and expert opinions through surveys or expert panels.
3. Design an integration module to incorporate these data sources into the idea generation algorithm.
4. Generate and iteratively refine ideas using feedback from these sources by re-evaluating the generated ideas with the new data.
5. Compare the quality of ideas generated using this multi-modal approach with the baseline method using the review score from perform_review() as the evaluation metric.
