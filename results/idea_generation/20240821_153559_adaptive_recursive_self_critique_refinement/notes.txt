# Title: Adaptive Recursive Self-Critique and Refinement System for Robust and Diverse Idea Generation in Automated Research
# Experiment description: 1. Modify generate_ideas() to produce a small set of initial ideas. 2. Implement critique_ideas() function that analyzes ideas for potential weaknesses, contradictions, or areas for improvement, incorporating both internal logic and external research criteria. 3. Create refine_ideas() function that takes original ideas and their critiques as input and produces improved versions. 4. Develop an adaptive loop in the main idea generation process that calls critique_ideas() and refine_ideas() multiple times, with the number of iterations based on available computational resources. 5. Implement a diversity maintenance mechanism to ensure a variety of high-quality ideas are preserved throughout the process. 6. Add a quantitative evaluation step after each iteration to measure idea improvement. 7. Use perform_review() to evaluate both the initial and final sets of ideas. 8. Compare the quality, robustness, diversity, and potential impact of ideas generated through ARSCRS with those from previous methods.
