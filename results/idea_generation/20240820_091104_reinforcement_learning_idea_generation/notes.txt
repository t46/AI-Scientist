# Title: Adaptive Idea Generation with Reinforcement Learning: A Novel Approach for Automated Research Paper Generation
# Experiment description: In this experiment, we will implement a reinforcement learning framework within the current idea generation pipeline. The RL agent will be trained using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is known for its robustness and efficiency. The reward mechanism will be designed to provide positive rewards for high scores in novelty, significance, feasibility, and interestingness, and negative rewards for low scores. The feedback loop will involve evaluating generated ideas using the review scores and novelty checks, which will be used to update the RL agent's strategy. We will compare the performance of this new method against existing methods using metrics such as review scores, novelty checks, and significance ratings. Functions to be added include the PPO algorithm implementation, reward mechanism, and feedback loop. Results will be obtained by running multiple iterations of idea generation and evaluation.
