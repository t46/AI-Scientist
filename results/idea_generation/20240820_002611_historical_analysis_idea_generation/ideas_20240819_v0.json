We then run the modified idea generation method and compare it against the baseline on the review scores.

This involves using prompts that specifically ask the model to assess potential ethical concerns alongside generating the research ideas, guided by existing ethical guidelines. We will implement an ethical review checklist based on common research ethics principles to score the ethical soundness of each idea. The modified idea generation method will be compared against the baseline on both review scores and the new ethical rating metric. The impact of embedding ethical analysis on the quality, novelty, and ethical soundness of the generated research ideas will be evaluated.",
