Use existing NLP models to evaluate the novelty and relevance of ideas. Define new metrics for evaluation, such as creativity score and cross-disciplinary relevance, and compare the performance of this method with traditional methods using these metrics and review scores.",

Implement small-scale preliminary experiments using perform_experiment() to gather quick performance metrics such as initial review scores and resource utilization. Use these metrics to refine and adapt subsequent ideas in real-time.
