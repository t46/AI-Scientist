This self-improving system creates a memory bank of past ideas and reviews, analyzes review feedback, and adapts the idea generation process based on learned patterns of successful ideas. AIR uniquely applies meta-learning principles to the domain of research idea generation.",
        "Experiment": "Modify the generate_ideas() function to incorporate the AIR method: 1) Create a data structure to store past ideas and their reviews. 2) Implement an analysis function to extract insights from reviews. 3) Modify the idea generation process to use these insights. Run multiple iterations of the entire process (idea generation, paper writing, review) and compare the quality of ideas and resulting papers over time. Include a parallel run with a non-adaptive baseline method for comparison. Monitor computational resources used for storage and analysis.",

        "Method": "We propose the Idea Fusion and Evolution (IFE) method, which applies principles from genetic algorithms to research idea generation. IFE generates a pool of initial ideas, analyzes their components, creates 'offspring' ideas by combining elements from different 'parent' ideas, applies mutations, and selects promising ideas for the next generation. IFE incorporates a dynamic fitness evaluation system that considers multiple factors including novelty, feasibility, and potential impact. To maintain diversity, it employs techniques like niching and adaptive mutation rates.",

Metrics should include individual idea ratings, population diversity measures, and improvement rates across generations.",

ATACIG creates a 'trend vector' based on characteristics of highly-rated past ideas, then uses contrastive learning techniques to generate new ideas that are distinct from but related to this trend. This approach balances novelty with relevance and incorporates a self-improving mechanism.",

Modify generate_ideas() to implement ATACIG: a) Create a function to analyze past idea ratings and construct a trend vector. b) Implement a contrastive learning algorithm to generate ideas distinct from but related to the trend vector. c) Develop a mechanism to identify potential gaps based on low-rated areas. d) Create a scoring system that balances novelty, trend-alignment, and potential impact. 2. Run multiple iterations of the idea generation process, allowing ATACIG to learn and adapt over time. 3. Compare ATACIG-generated ideas with those from previous methods using metrics like novelty, trend-alignment, and improvement over iterations. 4. Analyze the distribution of generated ideas and their alignment with identified gaps. 5. Evaluate the computational efficiency and how it changes over iterations.",
