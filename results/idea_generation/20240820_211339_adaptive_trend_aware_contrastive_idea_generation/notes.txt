# Title: Adaptive Trend-Aware Contrastive Idea Generation: Self-Improving AI Research Ideation
# Experiment description: 1. Modify generate_ideas() to implement ATACIG: a) Create a function to analyze past idea ratings and construct a trend vector. b) Implement a contrastive learning algorithm to generate ideas distinct from but related to the trend vector. c) Develop a mechanism to identify potential gaps based on low-rated areas. d) Create a scoring system that balances novelty, trend-alignment, and potential impact. 2. Run multiple iterations of the idea generation process, allowing ATACIG to learn and adapt over time. 3. Compare ATACIG-generated ideas with those from previous methods using metrics like novelty, trend-alignment, and improvement over iterations. 4. Analyze the distribution of generated ideas and their alignment with identified gaps. 5. Evaluate the computational efficiency and how it changes over iterations.
