#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Temporal Trend-Based Idea Generation for Future-Oriented Research.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: 1. Modify generate_ideas() to integrate a statistical method for temporal trend analysis. Use historical research data to identify trends and predict emerging topics. 2. Generate research ideas based on these predicted trends. 3. Evaluate the generated ideas using perform_review() and gather feedback on novelty, interestingness, and review scores. 4. Compare the performance of this method against the baseline using the collected review scores, focusing on improvements in novelty, interestingness, and overall review scores..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'result': {'Soundness': 2.0, 'Presentation': 2.0, 'Contribution': 2.0, 'Overall': 3.0, 'Confidence': 4.0, 'Originality': 2.0, 'Quality': 2.0, 'Clarity': 2.0, 'Significance': 2.0, 'Decision_Numeric': 0.0, 'Ethical_Concerns_Numeric': 0.0}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

### Plan for Experiments

We will conduct a series of experiments to integrate temporal trend analysis into the idea generation process. The experiments will be divided into the following runs:

1. **Run 1**: Implement a basic temporal trend analysis using linear regression on historical research data to predict emerging topics.
2. **Run 2**: Enhance the trend analysis by incorporating polynomial regression to capture non-linear trends.
3. **Run 3**: Use a more sophisticated time series forecasting method, such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).
4. **Run 4**: Combine multiple forecasting methods (ensemble approach) to improve prediction accuracy.
5. **Run 5**: Fine-tune the best-performing method from the previous runs by adjusting hyperparameters.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Run 1: Basic Temporal Trend Analysis using Linear Regression

1. Modify `generate_ideas()` to integrate linear regression for temporal trend analysis.
2. Use historical research data to identify trends and predict emerging topics.
3. Generate research ideas based on these predicted trends.

Let's start by implementing the changes for Run 1.

#### Modify `generate_ideas()` for Linear Regression

        model = LinearRegression()
        model.fit(years, counts)
        future_years = np.array([2021, 2022, 2023]).reshape(-1, 1)
        predictions = model.predict(future_years)

    return trends

This implementation will allow us to run the first experiment using linear regression for temporal trend analysis. Once this is done, we can proceed to the next steps.

Please run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1` to execute the first experiment.

####     idea['Significance']  
####     ~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
#### KeyError: 'Significance'  

To fix the `KeyError: 'Significance'`, we need to ensure that the `select_best_idea` function in `idea_generation_module.py` handles cases where the 'Significance' key might not be present in the idea dictionary. We can add a default value or handle the missing key appropriately.

Let's update the `select_best_idea` function to handle this case.

idea_generation_module.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    idea['Significance']
    ~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
KeyError: 'Significance'
=======
    idea.get('Significance', 0)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please update the file and re-run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1`.

Let's update the `select_best_idea` function in `idea_generation_module.py` to handle cases where the 'Significance' key might not be present in the idea dictionary. We will use the `get` method to provide a default value if the key is missing.

Here is the correct *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

idea_generation_module.py
<source>python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        total_score = (
            idea['Interestingness'] +
            idea['Feasibility'] +
            idea['Novelty'] +
            idea['Significance']
        )
=======
        total_score = (
            idea.get('Interestingness', 0) +
            idea.get('Feasibility', 0) +
            idea.get('Novelty', 0) +
            idea.get('Significance', 0)
        )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</source>

Please update the file and re-run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1`.
