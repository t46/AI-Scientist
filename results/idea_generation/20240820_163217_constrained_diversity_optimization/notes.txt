# Title: Constrained Diversity Optimization: A Novel Approach to Balanced and Rigorous Automated Research Idea Generation
# Experiment description: 1. Define a set of scientific constraints (logical consistency, testability, potential for empirical validation).
2. Implement a simple diversity metric based on key terms extracted from idea descriptions.
3. Modify generate_ideas() to incorporate constraint checking and diversity optimization.
4. Generate ideas in batches of 10, iteratively optimizing for diversity while ensuring each idea meets the scientific constraints.
5. Implement a function to evaluate the overall diversity of the generated idea set.
6. Compare the new method with baseline and previous methods on metrics of idea quality (using perform_review()) and overall set diversity.
7. Analyze and visualize the distribution of ideas in the concept space to demonstrate diversity improvement.
8. Evaluate the potential impact on creating more comprehensive and balanced research agendas.
