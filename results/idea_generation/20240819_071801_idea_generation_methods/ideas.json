        "Experiment": "In this experiment, we generate an initial set of research ideas and iteratively refine them through 5 cycles of review and reflection. Each iteration involves evaluating the ideas using perform_review(), refining them based on feedback, and re-evaluating their quality. Feedback will be systematically incorporated to improve both the novelty and feasibility of the ideas. The primary metrics for evaluation will be the review scores and improvements in novelty and feasibility ratings over the iterations. Success will be measured as a statistically significant improvement in these metrics across iterations.",

One model will generate an initial set of ideas, and another model will refine these ideas. The final set of refined ideas will be evaluated using perform_review(). The performance of the sequential model collaboration will be compared to single-model generation in terms of review scores, novelty, and feasibility. Success will be measured as a statistically significant improvement in these metrics for the collaborative approach.",
