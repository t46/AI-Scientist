        "Experiment": "Implement a multi-agent system where multiple AI agents generate, critique, and improve research ideas collaboratively. Each agent specializes in different evaluation aspects (e.g., novelty, feasibility, significance). Agents will communicate through a central hub that aggregates feedback and facilitates idea refinement. Conflicts or discrepancies in evaluations will be resolved through a weighted voting mechanism or consensus algorithm. Each agent will have clearly defined evaluation criteria: novelty agents assess the uniqueness and originality of ideas, feasibility agents evaluate the practical implementation and resource requirements, and significance agents analyze the potential impact on the research field. The performance of this multi-agent system will be compared against the single-agent system based on the quality and diversity of generated ideas, evaluated using the review scores from perform_review().",
