#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Idea Generation Methods: Comparing different idea generation methods for automated research paper generation..  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: In this experiment, we compare the performance of different idea generation methods (perform_generate_idea()) on automated research paper generation performance. We use the review score by (perform_review()) as the evaluation metric..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'result': {'Soundness': 2.0, 'Presentation': 2.0, 'Contribution': 2.0, 'Overall': 3.0, 'Confidence': 4.0, 'Originality': 2.0, 'Quality': 2.0, 'Clarity': 2.0, 'Significance': 2.0, 'Decision_Numeric': 0.0, 'Ethical_Concerns_Numeric': 0.0}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

### Plan for Experiments

We will conduct experiments to compare different idea generation methods for automated research paper generation. The baseline results are already provided, so we will focus on the following idea generation methods:

1. **Method A**: Using `perform_generate_idea()` with default parameters.
2. **Method B**: Using `perform_generate_idea()` with increased creativity (e.g., higher temperature).
3. **Method C**: Using `perform_generate_idea()` with a different model.
4. **Method D**: Using `perform_generate_idea()` with additional constraints.
5. **Method E**: Using `perform_generate_idea()` with a combination of the above modifications.

Each method will be run once, and we will use the review score by `perform_review()` as the evaluation metric.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Run 1**: Implement Method A.
2. **Run 2**: Implement Method B.
3. **Run 3**: Implement Method C.
4. **Run 4**: Implement Method D.
5. **Run 5**: Implement Method E.

Let's start with **Run 1**.

### Run 1: Implement Method A

For Method A, we will use `perform_generate_idea()` with default parameters. This is essentially the baseline method, but we will run it to ensure consistency.

#### Changes to `experiment.py`

We need to modify the `generate_ideas` function call to specify the method for Run 1.

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
ideas = generate_ideas(
    base_dir,
    client=client,
    model=client_model,
    skip_generation=False,
    max_num_generations=NUM_IDEAS,
    num_reflections=NUM_REFLECTIONS,
)
=======
ideas = generate_ideas(
    base_dir,
    client=client,
    model=client_model,
    skip_generation=False,
    max_num_generations=NUM_IDEAS,
    num_reflections=NUM_REFLECTIONS,
    method="default"  # Method A: Default parameters
)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please run the following command to execute Run 1:
```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```

Once you have the results, we can proceed to the next run.

#### Run failed with the following error Traceback (most recent call last):  
####   File "/root/AI-Scientist/results/idea_generation/20240819_084142_idea_generation_methods/experiment.py", line 132, in <module>  
####     ideas = generate_ideas(  
####             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
#### TypeError: generate_ideas() got an unexpected keyword argument 'method'  

It seems that the `generate_ideas` function does not accept a `method` argument. We need to remove this argument from the function call.

Let's update the `experiment.py` file accordingly.

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    num_reflections=NUM_REFLECTIONS,
    method="default"  # Method A: Default parameters
=======
    num_reflections=NUM_REFLECTIONS
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please run the following command to execute Run 1 again:
```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```

Once you have the results, we can proceed to the next run.
