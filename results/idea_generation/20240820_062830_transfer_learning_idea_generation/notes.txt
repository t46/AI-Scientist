# Title: Enhancing Idea Generation in AI Research with Transfer Learning
# Experiment description: 1. Identify pre-trained models from related domains that can be fine-tuned for our idea generation task. 2. Modify the generate_ideas function to incorporate transfer learning techniques, including loading pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on our dataset. 3. Evaluate the generated ideas using the same metrics (novelty, significance, interestingness, feasibility) and compare the results with the current methods. 4. Analyze the impact of transfer learning on the quality and diversity of the generated ideas.
