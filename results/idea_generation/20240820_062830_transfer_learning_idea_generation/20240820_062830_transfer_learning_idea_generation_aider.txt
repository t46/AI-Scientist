#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Enhancing Idea Generation in AI Research with Transfer Learning.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: 1. Identify pre-trained models from related domains that can be fine-tuned for our idea generation task. 2. Modify the generate_ideas function to incorporate transfer learning techniques, including loading pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on our dataset. 3. Evaluate the generated ideas using the same metrics (novelty, significance, interestingness, feasibility) and compare the results with the current methods. 4. Analyze the impact of transfer learning on the quality and diversity of the generated ideas..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'result': {'Soundness': 2.0, 'Presentation': 2.0, 'Contribution': 2.0, 'Overall': 3.0, 'Confidence': 4.0, 'Originality': 2.0, 'Quality': 2.0, 'Clarity': 2.0, 'Significance': 2.0, 'Decision_Numeric': 0.0, 'Ethical_Concerns_Numeric': 0.0}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

### Plan for Experiments

We will conduct a series of experiments to incorporate transfer learning into the idea generation process. The experiments will be divided into the following runs:

1. **Run 1**: Use a pre-trained model from a related domain without any fine-tuning.
2. **Run 2**: Fine-tune the pre-trained model on our dataset with a small learning rate.
3. **Run 3**: Fine-tune the pre-trained model on our dataset with a medium learning rate.
4. **Run 4**: Fine-tune the pre-trained model on our dataset with a large learning rate.
5. **Run 5**: Use an ensemble of fine-tuned models to generate ideas.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Identify Pre-trained Models**: We will use a pre-trained model from a related domain (e.g., GPT-3 or BERT).
2. **Modify `generate_ideas` Function**: Incorporate transfer learning techniques, including loading pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on our dataset.
3. **Evaluate Generated Ideas**: Use the same metrics (novelty, significance, interestingness, feasibility) to evaluate the generated ideas and compare the results with the baseline.
4. **Analyze Impact**: Analyze the impact of transfer learning on the quality and diversity of the generated ideas.

### Step 1: Identify Pre-trained Models

We will use the `transformers` library from Hugging Face to load pre-trained models. Let's start by modifying the `experiment.py` file to include the necessary imports and functions for loading and fine-tuning pre-trained models.

### Step 2: Modify `generate_ideas` Function

We will modify the `generate_ideas` function to incorporate transfer learning techniques.

### Step 3: Evaluate Generated Ideas

We will use the same metrics (novelty, significance, interestingness, feasibility) to evaluate the generated ideas and compare the results with the baseline.

### Step 4: Analyze Impact

We will analyze the impact of transfer learning on the quality and diversity of the generated ideas.

Please run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1` to execute the first experiment. Once the results are available, we can proceed with the next steps.

The error indicates that the model identifier `gpt-2` is not recognized. We need to ensure that the model identifier is valid and available on Hugging Face's model hub.

Let's change the model identifier to a valid one, such as `gpt2` (the correct identifier for GPT-2 on Hugging Face).

The error indicates that the key `'Significance'` is missing from one of the ideas in the `ideas` list. To handle this, we can add a check to ensure that all required keys are present in each idea before attempting to access them. If any key is missing, we can set a default value.

Let's update the `select_best_idea` function to handle missing keys gracefully.
