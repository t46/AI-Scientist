# Title: Integrating Diverse Perspectives in Idea Generation for Enhanced Research Innovation
# Experiment description: In this experiment, we modify the generate_ideas() function to incorporate diverse perspectives by simulating different disciplinary focuses. This involves using pre-defined categories such as natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering to generate ideas within these contexts. We will then combine these ideas to form a final set of research ideas. The performance of these ideas will be compared against those generated without this integration, using review scores from perform_review() as our evaluation metric.
