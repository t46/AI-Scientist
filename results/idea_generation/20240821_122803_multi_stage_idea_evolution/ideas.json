Each iteration, the system generates ideas, uses them to guide a literature search, extracts key concepts and findings to update a simple knowledge base, and then uses this enhanced knowledge to inform the next round of idea generation. This cycle continues, producing increasingly refined and literature-grounded research proposals.",
